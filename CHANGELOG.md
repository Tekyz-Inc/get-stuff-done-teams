### Added
- SessionStart hook script (`~/.claude/scripts/gsd-t-update-check.js`) for automatic update notifications in Claude Code sessions

## [2.11.4] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- Reduced update check cache duration from 24 hours to 1 hour — new releases are detected faster

## [2.11.2] - 2026-02-12

## [2.11.1] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
