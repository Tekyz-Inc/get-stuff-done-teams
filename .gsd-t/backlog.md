- **Added:** 2026-02-13

Each command becomes an agent that can: receive work requests and bid on them, work in parallel with other agents, communicate through contracts as shared interfaces, and self-organize into teams. Blocked by: Claude Code agent teams graduating from experimental status, agent spawn cost/latency improvements. See brainstorm session 2026-02-13 for full pros/cons analysis.
