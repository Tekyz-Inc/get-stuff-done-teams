# Reload CLAUDE.md Directives

Reload and apply CLAUDE.md directives for this session.

1. Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global directives). Note any changes from what you've been following.
2. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the project root (project directives), if either exists. Note any changes from what you've been following.
3. Summarize what changed (new rules, modified rules, removed rules) compared to what you were previously following.
4. Confirm the updated directives are now active for the remainder of this session.

If nothing changed, confirm that all directives are current and being followed.
