# GSD-T: Wave — Full Cycle Orchestration (Agent-Per-Phase)

You are the wave orchestrator. You do NOT execute phases yourself. Instead, you spawn an **independent agent for each phase**, giving each a fresh context window. This eliminates context accumulation across phases and prevents mid-wave compaction.

## Step 1: Load State (Lightweight)

Read ONLY:
1. `.gsd-t/progress.md` — current status, milestone name, phase state
2. `CLAUDE.md` — autonomy level only (scan for Level 1/2/3)

Do NOT read contracts, domains, docs, or source code. You are the orchestrator — phase agents handle their own context loading.

### Integrity Check

After reading progress.md, verify it contains the required fields before proceeding:
- **Status field**: A `Status:` line with a recognized value (DEFINED, PARTITIONED, PLANNED, etc.)
- **Milestone name**: A `Milestone` heading or table entry identifying the current milestone
- **Domains table**: A `| Domain |` table with at least one row

If ANY of these are missing or malformed, STOP and report:
"Wave cannot proceed — progress.md is missing required fields: {list}. Run `/user:gsd-t-status` to inspect, or `/user:gsd-t-init` to repair."
Do NOT attempt to fix progress.md yourself — that risks data loss.

## Step 2: Determine Resume Point

From progress.md status, determine which phase to start from:

| Status | Next Phase |
|--------|------------|
| READY | Need milestone first — prompt user or run milestone |
| INITIALIZED / DEFINED | Partition |
| PARTITIONED | Discuss (or skip to Plan if path is clear) |
| DISCUSSED | Plan |
| PLANNED | Impact |
| IMPACT_ANALYZED | Execute |
| EXECUTED | Test-Sync |
| TESTS_SYNCED | Integrate |
| INTEGRATED | Verify |
| VERIFIED | Complete |
| VERIFY_FAILED | Remediate → re-Verify |

## Step 3: Phase Orchestration Loop

For each remaining phase, spawn an **independent agent** using the Task tool. Each agent gets a fresh context window, loads its own state from files, and reports back.

### Graph Availability

If `.gsd-t/graph/meta.json` exists, the code graph is available for all phases. Each phase agent's spawn prompt should include:
"If .gsd-t/graph/meta.json exists, use graph queries (getCallers, getDomainBoundaryViolations, getTestsFor, etc.) to enhance analysis per the phase command instructions."

### Phase Agent Spawn Pattern

For each phase, spawn the agent like this:

**OBSERVABILITY LOGGING (MANDATORY) — repeat for every phase spawn:**
Before spawning — run via Bash:
`T_START=$(date +%s) && DT_START=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") && TOK_START=${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_USED:-0} && TOK_MAX=${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_MAX:-200000}`

```
Task agent (subagent_type: "general-purpose", mode: "bypassPermissions"):
  "Execute the {PHASE} phase of the current GSD-T milestone.

   Read and follow the full instructions in commands/gsd-t-{phase}.md
   Read .gsd-t/progress.md for current milestone and state.
   Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
   Read .gsd-t/contracts/ for domain interfaces.

   Complete the phase fully:
   - Follow every step in the command file
   - Update .gsd-t/progress.md status when done
   - Run document ripple as specified
   - Commit your work

   Report back: one-line status summary."
```

After phase agent returns — run via Bash:
`T_END=$(date +%s) && DT_END=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M") && TOK_END=${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_USED:-0} && DURATION=$((T_END-T_START))`
Compute tokens and compaction:
- No compaction (TOK_END >= TOK_START): `TOKENS=$((TOK_END-TOK_START))`, COMPACTED=null
- Compaction detected (TOK_END < TOK_START): `TOKENS=$(((TOK_MAX-TOK_START)+TOK_END))`, COMPACTED=$DT_END
Compute context utilization — run via Bash:
`if [ "${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_MAX:-0}" -gt 0 ]; then CTX_PCT=$(echo "scale=1; ${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_USED:-0} * 100 / ${CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_MAX}" | bc); else CTX_PCT="N/A"; fi`
Alert on context thresholds (display to user inline):
- If CTX_PCT >= 85: `echo "🔴 CRITICAL: Context at ${CTX_PCT}% — compaction likely. Task MUST be split."`
- If CTX_PCT >= 70: `echo "⚠️ WARNING: Context at ${CTX_PCT}% — approaching compaction threshold. Consider splitting in plan."`
Append to `.gsd-t/token-log.md` (create with header `| Datetime-start | Datetime-end | Command | Step | Model | Duration(s) | Notes | Tokens | Compacted | Domain | Task | Ctx% |` if missing):
`| {DT_START} | {DT_END} | gsd-t-wave | {PHASE} | sonnet | {DURATION}s | phase: {PHASE} | {TOKENS} | {COMPACTED} | | | {CTX_PCT} |`

### Phase Sequence

Execute phases in this order, spawning one agent per phase:

#### 1. PARTITION
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-partition.md`
- After: Read `progress.md`, verify status = PARTITIONED
- If failed: Report error, stop

#### 2. DISCUSS (conditional)
- **Structured skip check** — skip discuss and go directly to Plan if ALL of these are true:
  - (a) Single domain milestone (only one entry in Domains table)
  - (b) No items containing "OPEN QUESTION" in the Decision Log
  - (c) For multi-domain milestones: all cross-domain contracts exist in `.gsd-t/contracts/`
- If ANY check fails: Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-discuss.md`
  - **Note**: Discuss always pauses for user input, even at Level 3. The discuss agent will interact with the user directly.
- If all checks pass: Skip to Plan

#### 3. PLAN
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-plan.md`
- After: Read `progress.md`, verify status = PLANNED

#### 4. IMPACT
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-impact.md`
- After: Read `progress.md` and `.gsd-t/impact-report.md`
- **Decision Gate**:
  - PROCEED → continue to Execute
  - PROCEED WITH CAUTION → log items, continue
  - BLOCK → stop, report to user, wait for decision

#### 5. EXECUTE
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-execute.md`
- This is the heaviest phase. The execute agent uses **task-level dispatch** (fresh-dispatch-contract.md): one Task subagent per task within each domain, each receiving only scope.md + relevant contracts + single task + graph context + up to 5 prior summaries. The execute agent handles domain task-dispatching and QA internally.
- **Team/parallel mode**: If the plan defines parallel domains (same wave), the execute agent dispatches each domain teammate with `isolation: "worktree"` (per worktree-isolation-contract.md). Each domain works in an isolated git worktree. After all domains complete, the execute agent runs the Sequential Merge Protocol: merge domain A → test → merge domain B → test. Per-domain rollback if tests fail. Worktrees are cleaned up after all merges complete.
- After: Read `progress.md`, verify status = EXECUTED

#### 6. TEST-SYNC
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-test-sync.md`
- After: Read `progress.md`, verify status = TESTS_SYNCED

#### 7. INTEGRATE
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-integrate.md`
- After: Read `progress.md`, verify status = INTEGRATED

#### 8. VERIFY
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-verify.md`
- After: Read `progress.md`, check status:
  - VERIFIED → proceed to Complete
  - VERIFY_FAILED → handle remediation (see Error Recovery)

#### 9. COMPLETE
Spawn agent → `commands/gsd-t-complete-milestone.md`
- After: Read `progress.md`, verify status = COMPLETED

### Between Each Phase

After each agent completes, run this spot-check before proceeding:

1. **Status check**: Read `.gsd-t/progress.md` — verify the phase updated status correctly (no FAILED markers, status matches expected phase completion state)
2. **Git check**: Run `git log --oneline -5` — verify commits were made during this phase (if execute/integrate: at least one commit per task completed)
3. **Filesystem check**: Verify key output files exist on disk — e.g., for partition: `.gsd-t/domains/*/scope.md` and `.gsd-t/contracts/` files; for execute: newly created source files; for verify: `.gsd-t/verify-report.md`. Do not trust agent-reported completions alone.
4. Report to user:
   ```
   ✅ {Phase} complete — {agent's one-line summary}
   📋 Spot-check: {N} commits | {N} output files verified | no FAILED markers
   ```
5. If spot-check fails: write failure event via Bash, then report the discrepancy, re-spawn the phase agent once to correct it, then re-verify. If still failing: stop and report to user.
   ```bash
   node ~/.claude/scripts/gsd-t-event-writer.js \
     --type phase_transition \
     --command gsd-t-wave \
     --phase {COMPLETED_PHASE} \
     --reasoning "Spot-check failed: {one-line discrepancy summary}" \
     --outcome failure \
     --agent-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-unknown}" || true
   ```
5a. After spot-check passes, write success event via Bash:
   ```bash
   node ~/.claude/scripts/gsd-t-event-writer.js \
     --type phase_transition \
     --command gsd-t-wave \
     --phase {COMPLETED_PHASE} \
     --reasoning "Phase complete: {one-line spot-check summary}" \
     --outcome success \
     --agent-id "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-unknown}" || true
   ```
   The `|| true` ensures event write failure never blocks wave execution.
6. Proceed to next phase

## Step 4: Autonomy Behavior

**Level 3 (Full Auto)**: Auto-advance to next phase after each agent completes. Only STOP for:
- Destructive Action Guard violations (reported by phase agent)
- Impact analysis BLOCK verdict
- Unrecoverable errors after 2 fix attempts
- Discuss phase (always pauses for user input)

**Level 1–2**: Pause between phases, show status, ask to continue.

## Step 5: Completion

When all phases are done:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ Milestone "{name}" complete!
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📁 Archived to: .gsd-t/milestones/{name}-{date}/
🏷️  Tagged as: milestone/{name}

Summary:
- Domains: {list}
- Tasks completed: {N}
- Contracts: {N} defined/verified
- Tests: {N} added/updated
- Impact items addressed: {N}
- Decision log entries: {N}

Next steps:
- Push tag: git push origin milestone/{name}
- Start next: /user:gsd-t-milestone "{next}"
- View roadmap: /user:gsd-t-status
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Interruption Handling

If the user interrupts or a phase agent fails:
1. The current phase agent saves its own state to `.gsd-t/progress.md`
2. Report: "Paused at {phase}. Run `/user:gsd-t-resume` to continue."
3. Resume will pick up from the last completed phase

## Error Recovery

### If impact analysis blocks:
- Read the impact report from the agent's output
- Report blocking issues to user

**Level 3**: Spawn a remediation agent to fix blocking issues, then re-spawn impact agent. Max 2 attempts.
**Level 1–2**: Ask user for direction.

### If tests fail during execute:
- The execute agent handles test failures internally (up to 2 fix attempts)
- If still failing after 2 attempts, the execute agent reports failure
- Orchestrator stops and reports to user

### If verify fails:
- Read verify report for failure details

**Level 3**: Spawn remediation agent, then re-spawn verify agent. Max 2 attempts.
**Level 1–2**: Ask user for direction.

## Why Agent-Per-Phase

Each phase agent gets a **fresh context window** (~200K tokens). This means:
- Phase 7 doesn't carry the context baggage from phases 1-6
- Mid-phase compaction is eliminated for standard-sized phases
- Each agent loads only what it needs from state files
- The orchestrator stays lightweight (~30KB total)

State handoff happens through `.gsd-t/` files — exactly what they were designed for.

## Security Considerations

### bypassPermissions Mode

Wave spawns each phase agent with `mode: "bypassPermissions"`. This means agents execute bash commands, write files, and perform git operations **without per-action user approval**. This is by design — wave phases would be impractical with manual approval at every step.

### Attack Surface

If command files in `~/.claude/commands/` are tampered with, wave agents will execute the modified instructions with full permissions. The attack requires:
1. Write access to the user's `~/.claude/commands/` directory
2. Knowledge of the GSD-T command file format
3. The user to run `/gsd-t-wave` after tampering

### Current Mitigations

- **npm-installed files**: Command files are installed from the npm registry, providing a known-good source
- **Content comparison on update**: `gsd-t update` compares file contents and reports changes
- **User-owned directory**: `~/.claude/commands/` inherits the user's filesystem permissions
- **Destructive Action Guard**: CLAUDE.md instructions provide soft protection against destructive operations (DROP TABLE, schema changes, etc.), though agents could theoretically ignore these
- **Autonomy levels**: Level 1 and Level 2 pause between phases, giving users visibility into agent activity

### Recommendations

- For sensitive projects, use **Level 1 or Level 2 autonomy** instead of Level 3 to review each phase's output
- Periodically verify command file integrity: `gsd-t doctor` checks installation health
- If security is a concern, audit `~/.claude/commands/gsd-t-*.md` files for unexpected modifications
- Keep GSD-T updated (`gsd-t update`) to receive the latest command files from npm
