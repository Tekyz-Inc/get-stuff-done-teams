# GSD-T: Contract-Driven Development for Claude Code

A methodology for reliable, parallelizable development using Claude Code with optional Agent Teams support.

## What It Does

**Solves context rot** — the quality degradation that happens as Claude fills its context window.

**Enables parallel execution** — contract-driven domains can be worked on simultaneously.

**Maintains test coverage** — automatically keeps tests aligned with code changes.

**Catches downstream effects** — analyzes impact before changes break things.

**Self-learning rule engine** — declarative rules detect failure patterns from task metrics. Patches progress through 5 lifecycle stages with measurable improvement gates before graduating into permanent methodology.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start Claude Code in your project
cd my-project
claude

# 2. Full onboarding (git + init + scan + setup in one)
/user:gsd-t-init-scan-setup

# Or step by step:
/user:gsd-t-init my-project

# 3. Define what you're building
/user:gsd-t-milestone "User Authentication System"

# 5. Let it rip (auto-advances through all phases)
/user:gsd-t-wave

# Or go phase by phase for more control:
/user:gsd-t-partition
/user:gsd-t-discuss
/user:gsd-t-plan
/user:gsd-t-impact
/user:gsd-t-execute
/user:gsd-t-test-sync
/user:gsd-t-integrate
/user:gsd-t-verify
/user:gsd-t-complete-milestone
```

## Resuming After a Break

```bash
claude
/user:gsd-t-resume
```

GSD-T reads all state files and tells you exactly where you left off.

## Stack Rules Engine

GSD-T auto-detects your project's tech stack and injects mandatory best-practice rules into subagent prompts at execute-time. This ensures stack conventions are enforced at the same weight as contract compliance — violations are task failures, not warnings.

### How It Works

1. At subagent spawn time, GSD-T reads project manifest files to detect the active stack(s).
2. Universal rules (`templates/stacks/_security.md`, `_auth.md`) are **always** injected.
3. Stack-specific rules are injected when the corresponding stack is detected.
4. Project-level overrides in `.gsd-t/stacks/` replace global files of the same name.
5. Rules are appended to the subagent prompt as a `## Stack Rules (MANDATORY)` section.

### Stack Detection (28 files)

| Project File | Detected Stack(s) |
|---|---|
| *(always)* | `_security.md`, `_auth.md` |
| `package.json` with `"react"` | `react.md` |
| `package.json` with `"react-native"` | `react-native.md` |
| `package.json` with `"next"` | `nextjs.md` |
| `package.json` with `"vue"` | `vue.md` |
| `package.json` with `"typescript"` or `tsconfig.json` | `typescript.md` |
| `package.json` with `"tailwindcss"` | `tailwind.md` |
| `package.json` with `"express"`, `"fastify"`, `"hono"`, or `"koa"` | `node-api.md`, `rest-api.md` |
| `package.json` with `"vite"` | `vite.md` |
| `package.json` with `"@supabase/supabase-js"` | `supabase.md` |
| `package.json` with `"firebase"` | `firebase.md` |
| `package.json` with `"graphql"` or `"@apollo/server"` | `graphql.md` |
| `package.json` with `"zustand"` | `zustand.md` |
| `package.json` with `"@reduxjs/toolkit"` | `redux.md` |
| `package.json` with `"prisma"` or `"@prisma/client"` | `prisma.md` |
| `package.json` with `"pg"`, `"knex"`, or `"drizzle-orm"` | `postgresql.md` |
| `package.json` with `"neo4j-driver"` | `neo4j.md` |
| `package.json` with `"bullmq"`, `"bull"`, `"amqplib"`, or `"@aws-sdk/client-sqs"` | `queues.md` |
| `package.json` with `"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"langchain"` | `llm.md` |
| `Dockerfile` or `compose.yaml` | `docker.md` |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | `github-actions.md` |
| `playwright.config.*` | `playwright.md` |
| `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` | `python.md` |
| `requirements.txt` with `fastapi` | `fastapi.md` |
| `requirements.txt` with `celery`, `dramatiq`, `rq`, or `arq` | `queues.md` |
| `requirements.txt` with `openai`, `anthropic`, `langchain` | `llm.md` |
| `pubspec.yaml` | `flutter.md` |
| `.gsd-t/contracts/design-contract.md`, `design-tokens.json`, `design-tokens/`, `.figmarc`, `figma.config.json`, or Figma MCP in `settings.json` | `design-to-code.md` |

### Commands That Inject Stack Rules

`gsd-t-execute`, `gsd-t-quick`, `gsd-t-integrate`, `gsd-t-wave`, `gsd-t-debug`

### Extending

Drop a `.md` file into `templates/stacks/` to add a new stack. Files prefixed with `_` are universal (always injected). Files without a prefix are stack-specific (injected only when detected). If the `stacks/` directory is missing, detection skips silently — no error.

---

## Unattended Execution (M36)

Run the active milestone to completion over hours or days with zero human intervention. The unattended supervisor is an OS-level process that spawns `claude -p` workers in a relay — each worker runs in a fresh context window, completing one round of wave tasks before handing off to the next. The supervisor survives `/clear`, terminal close, and sleep/wake cycles (macOS/Linux; see `docs/unattended-windows-caveats.md` for Windows).

**Relay model**: Each iteration spawns a fresh `claude -p` session with a compact prompt derived from `.gsd-t/progress.md` state. The supervisor waits for the worker to exit, records the exit code in `state.json`, runs safety checks (gutter detection, blocker sentinel scan), and spawns the next worker. Workers never overlap. Context rot is impossible — each worker starts clean.

**Watch loop**: `/user:gsd-t-unattended` starts an in-session ScheduleWakeup loop that ticks every 270 seconds. Each tick reads `state.json` and `supervisor.pid` to render a live progress block. When the supervisor reaches a terminal state (`done`, `failed`, `stopped`), the watch loop stops rescheduling and prints a final summary. A `/clear` + `/user:gsd-t-resume` transparently re-attaches: the resume command checks for a live `supervisor.pid` and re-starts the watch loop automatically.

**Safety rails**: Branch protection (refuses to run on `main`/`master`/`release/*` by default), dirty-tree check (whitelists GSD-T runtime files), per-iteration gutter detection (repeated error patterns, file thrash, no-progress stall), wall-clock and iteration caps, and a blocker sentinel that halts on unrecoverable worker errors.

**Contract**: `.gsd-t/contracts/unattended-supervisor-contract.md` v1.0.0 is the authoritative reference for the state file schema, exit codes, CLI surface, and platform matrix.

---

## Headless Mode

Run GSD-T non-interactively in CI/CD pipelines or automated workflows.

### headless exec

```bash
gsd-t headless verify --json --timeout=1200  # Run verify non-interactively
gsd-t headless execute --json                # Execute tasks without interactive prompts
```

### headless query

```bash
gsd-t headless query status   # Project state — no LLM, <100ms
gsd-t headless query domains  # Domain list with status
```

### headless debug-loop

Compaction-proof automated test-fix-retest cycles. Each iteration runs as a separate `claude -p` session with fresh context. A cumulative debug ledger (`.gsd-t/debug-state.jsonl`) preserves all hypothesis/fix/learning history across sessions. An anti-repetition preamble is injected into each session to prevent retrying failed approaches.

```bash
gsd-t headless --debug-loop [--max-iterations=N] [--test-cmd=CMD] [--fix-scope=PATTERN] [--json] [--log]
```

**Flags:**

| Flag               | Default | Description |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-iterations` | 20      | Hard ceiling on iterations |
| `--test-cmd`       | (auto)  | Override test command (auto-detected from project) |
| `--fix-scope`      | (all)   | Limit fix scope to specific files or patterns |
| `--json`           | false   | Structured JSON output after each iteration |
| `--log`            | false   | Write per-iteration logs to `.gsd-t/` |

**Escalation tiers:**

| Iterations | Model  | Behavior |
|------------|--------|----------|
| 1–5        | sonnet | Standard debug — one fix per session |
| 6–15       | opus   | Deeper reasoning — reads full ledger, may attempt multi-file fixes |
| 16–20      | STOP   | Write full diagnostic summary, present to user, exit code 4 |

**Exit codes:** `0` all tests pass · `1` max iterations reached · `2` compaction error · `3` process error · `4` needs human decision

**Auto-escalation from commands:** `gsd-t-execute`, `gsd-t-test-sync`, `gsd-t-verify`, `gsd-t-debug`, and `gsd-t-wave` delegate to `--debug-loop` automatically after 2 failed in-context fix attempts.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Contracts are the source of truth.** Code implements contracts, not the other way around. If code and contract disagree, fix one or the other — never leave them inconsistent.

2. **Domains own files exclusively.** No two domains should modify the same file. If they need shared state, that's a contract.

3. **Impact before execution.** Always analyze downstream effects before making changes. Surprises are expensive.

4. **Tests stay synced.** Every code change triggers test analysis. Gaps are caught immediately, not in production.

5. **State survives sessions.** Everything is in `.gsd-t/`. A fresh Claude Code session can resume from any point by reading the state files.

6. **Plan is single-brain, execute is multi-brain.** Planning, impact analysis, and integration require full context (always solo). Execution and verification can parallelize.

7. **Every decision is logged.** The Decision Log in progress.md captures why, not just what. Future sessions don't need to re-derive decisions.

---

## Enabling Agent Teams

Agent Teams is an experimental feature. Enable it:

```bash
# Environment variable
export CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1

# Or in settings.json
{ "experimental": { "agentTeams": true } }
```

Teams are optional — all commands work in solo mode without teams enabled.

### When to Use Teams

- 3+ domains with independent starting work
- Codebase scanning and feature impact analysis
- Complex design questions with multiple viable approaches
- Verification of large milestones
- Debugging cross-domain issues

---

## Configuration

GSD-T respects your project's `CLAUDE.md` for conventions and autonomy level.

### Autonomy Levels

| Level | Phase Behavior |
|-------|---------------|
| **Level 1: Supervised** | Pauses at each phase for confirmation |
| **Level 2: Standard** | Pauses at milestones |
| **Level 3: Full Auto** (default) | Auto-advances through all phases. Only stops for: Destructive Action Guard, impact BLOCK verdicts, unrecoverable errors (after 2 fix attempts), and the Discuss phase |

Set in your project's `CLAUDE.md` under `## Autonomy Level`.

Recommended `.gsd-t/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mode": "yolo",
  "model_profile": "quality",
  "workflow": {
    "research": true,
    "impact_check": true,
    "test_sync": true,
    "verifier": true
  }
}
```

### Context Meter (M34)

The Context Meter is a PostToolUse hook that runs after every tool call, streams the current Claude Code transcript to the Anthropic `count_tokens` API, and writes the exact input-token count and threshold band to `.gsd-t/.context-meter-state.json`. The GSD-T orchestrator (`gsd-t-execute`, `gsd-t-wave`, `gsd-t-quick`, `gsd-t-integrate`, `gsd-t-debug`) reads this state file via `token-budget.getSessionStatus()` as the authoritative context-burn signal — replacing the v2.74.12 task-counter proxy.

Setup:

1. **Export an API key** — `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."` (free-tier key is sufficient; `count_tokens` is inexpensive).
2. **Install the hook** — `npx @tekyzinc/gsd-t install` (registers the PostToolUse hook globally) then `npx @tekyzinc/gsd-t init` in each project (copies the hook runtime and config template).
3. **Verify with doctor** — `npx @tekyzinc/gsd-t doctor` hard-gates on API key presence, hook registration, script existence, config validity, and a live `count_tokens` dry-run.
4. **Check status** — `npx @tekyzinc/gsd-t status` shows a Context line with `{pct}% of {window} tokens ({band}) — last check {time ago}`.

`.gsd-t/context-meter-config.json` controls the meter:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "apiKeyEnvVar": "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
  "modelWindowSize": 200000,
  "thresholdPct": 85,
  "checkFrequency": 1
}
```

Threshold bands used by the orchestrator gate (v3.0.0 three-band model as of M35 / v2.76.10):

| Band      | Range       | Orchestrator action                                             |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| normal    | 0–69%       | Proceed as normal                                               |
| warn      | 70–84%      | Surface warning; runway estimator refuses if projection crosses |
| stop      | ≥85%        | Halt cleanly; headless auto-spawn continues in a fresh context  |

**Zero silent quality degradation.** There is no `downgrade` or `conserve` band anymore. When the runway estimator (`bin/runway-estimator.js`) projects a run will cross the 85% stop threshold, the command refuses to start. Instead of printing "please `/clear` and resume," it calls `bin/headless-auto-spawn.js` which detaches a child process to continue the work. The interactive session receives a single ⛔ banner and exits cleanly; the user is never blocked.

**Per-phase model selection** — see `bin/model-selector.js` for the declarative rules table (≥13 phase mappings). Each command file carries a `## Model Assignment` block documenting which phases run on haiku / sonnet / opus. Complexity signals (`cross_module_refactor`, `security_boundary`, `data_loss_risk`, `contract_design`) escalate sonnet→opus at plan time.

**`/advisor` escalation** — mid-phase escalation channel. If `/advisor` is programmable in the runtime, subagents invoke it directly; otherwise, the convention-based fallback (`bin/advisor-integration.js`) appends a `missed_escalation` marker to `.gsd-t/token-log.md`. See `.gsd-t/contracts/model-selection-contract.md` v1.0.0.

**`gsd-t metrics` CLI** — `gsd-t metrics` reads task telemetry for process ELO and domain health. The `--tokens` / `--halts` / `--context-window` flags read `.gsd-t/token-metrics.jsonl` when it exists from pre-M38 runs; M38 retires per-spawn telemetry emission along with the runway estimator and three-band meter (headless-by-default obviates pre-flight projection).

**Observability logging columns** — as of M34, the `.gsd-t/token-log.md` header includes `Ctx%` (the real session-wide context percentage at the time of the subagent spawn) replacing the earlier `Tasks-Since-Reset` column. The old column was a proxy count of how many tasks had run since the last `/clear`; the new column is the actual measurement.

**Upgrading from pre-M34** — `gsd-t update-all` handles the migration automatically:
- Copies the hook script, runtime files, and config template into every registered project
- Runs a one-time task-counter retirement (`bin/task-counter.cjs` + `.task-counter*` files deleted, `.gsd-t/.task-counter-retired-v1` marker written)
- Idempotent on second run

After upgrading, you **must** set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `gsd-t doctor` will fail.

**Historical note on v2.74.12–13**: between 2026-03 and 2026-04, the orchestrator used `bin/task-counter.cjs` as a proxy — it assumed N tasks ≈ M% context used. That was itself a replacement for an earlier env-var-based check (`CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_USED` / `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_TOKENS_MAX`) that never worked because Claude Code does not export those vars. The Context Meter (v2.75.10, M34) is the first version that measures context burn from the authoritative source: the Anthropic API itself.
