# Architecture — GSD-T Framework (@tekyzinc/gsd-t)

## Last Updated: 2026-02-18

## System Overview

GSD-T is an npm-distributed methodology framework for Claude Code. It provides slash commands (markdown files), a CLI installer (Node.js), and document templates that together enable contract-driven development with AI assistance.

The framework has no runtime — it is consumed entirely by Claude Code's slash command system and the user's shell. The CLI handles installation, updates, and diagnostics. The command files define the workflow methodology that Claude Code follows.

**Architecture Pattern**: Distributed Markdown Instruction System with CLI Lifecycle Manager. Command files are the "source code" interpreted by Claude Code. The CLI is a lifecycle manager (install/update/init/status/doctor/uninstall). State files persist across sessions as git-tracked Markdown.

## Components

### CLI Installer (bin/gsd-t.js)
- **Purpose**: Install, update, diagnose, and manage GSD-T across projects
- **Location**: `bin/gsd-t.js` (~1,300 lines)
- **Dependencies**: Node.js built-ins only (fs, path, os, child_process, https)
- **Subcommands**: install, update, status, doctor, init, uninstall, update-all, register, changelog
- **Organization**: Configuration → Guard section → Helpers → Heartbeat → Commands → Install/Update → Init → Status → Uninstall → Update-All → Doctor → Register → Update Check → Help → Main dispatch

### Slash Commands (commands/*.md)
- **Purpose**: Define the GSD-T methodology as executable workflows for Claude Code
- **Location**: `commands/`
- **Count**: 42 (38 GSD-T workflow + 4 utility: gsd, branch, checkin, Claude-md)
- **Format**: Pure markdown with step-numbered instructions, team mode blocks, document ripple sections, and $ARGUMENTS terminator

### Templates (templates/*.md)
- **Purpose**: Starter files for project initialization
- **Location**: `templates/`
- **Count**: 9 (CLAUDE-global, CLAUDE-project, requirements, architecture, workflows, infrastructure, progress, backlog, backlog-settings)
- **Tokens**: `{Project Name}` and `{Date}` replaced during init via `applyTokens()`

### Hook Scripts (scripts/)
- **gsd-t-heartbeat.js**: Real-time event logging via Claude Code hooks. Captures 9 event types as structured JSONL. Input capped at 1MB. Session ID validated. Path traversal protection. Auto-cleanup after 7 days.
- **npm-update-check.js**: Background npm registry version checker. Spawned detached by CLI when update cache is stale.

### Examples (examples/)
- **Purpose**: Reference project structure and settings
- **Location**: `examples/`
- **Contents**: settings.json, .gsd-t/ with sample contracts and domain structure

## Data Flow

### Installation Flow
```
npm install @tekyzinc/gsd-t → bin/gsd-t.js install
  ├── Copy commands/*.md → ~/.claude/commands/
  ├── Copy/append templates/CLAUDE-global.md → ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  ├── Copy scripts/gsd-t-heartbeat.js → ~/.claude/scripts/
  ├── Configure 9 hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json
  └── Write version to ~/.claude/.gsd-t-version
```

### Project Initialization Flow
```
gsd-t init [name] → templates/ → applyTokens()
  ├── → {project}/CLAUDE.md
  ├── → {project}/docs/{requirements,architecture,workflows,infrastructure}.md
  ├── → {project}/.gsd-t/{progress,backlog,backlog-settings}.md
  └── → {project}/.gsd-t/{contracts,domains}/.gitkeep
```

### Runtime Command Execution (within Claude Code)
```
User types /user:gsd-t-{command} [args]
  → Claude Code loads ~/.claude/commands/gsd-t-{command}.md
  → Claude interprets step-by-step instructions
  → Reads state files → Executes workflow → Pre-Commit Gate → Updates progress.md
```

### Update Check Flow
```
CLI command → Read cache (~/.claude/.gsd-t-update-check)
  ├── Fresh (<1h): Show notice if latest > installed
  ├── No cache: Synchronous fetch → cache → show notice
  └── Stale (>1h): Spawn background scripts/npm-update-check.js
```

## Configuration Model

Three-tier configuration:

| Layer | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Framework defaults: autonomy rules, code standards, pre-commit gate |
| **Project** | `{cwd}/CLAUDE.md` | Project-specific: tech stack, branch guard, conventions, overrides |
| **State** | `{cwd}/.gsd-t/` | Live state: progress, contracts, domains, backlog, scan results |

## State Files

| File | Purpose | Read By | Written By |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| `progress.md` | Master state, version, decision log | All commands | Most commands |
| `contracts/*.md` | Domain interfaces | execute, integrate, verify | partition |
| `domains/{name}/scope.md` | File ownership | execute, quick | partition |
| `domains/{name}/tasks.md` | Task list | execute, status, resume | plan, execute |
| `backlog.md` | Priority-ordered backlog | backlog-list, status | backlog-add/edit/move/remove |
| `backlog-settings.md` | Types, apps, categories | backlog-add/edit/settings | backlog-settings, init |
| `techdebt.md` | Prioritized tech debt | promote-debt, scan | scan |
| `scan/*.md` | Codebase analysis | scan (synthesis), setup | scan (teammates) |

## Data Models

### Progress State (.gsd-t/progress.md)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Project | string | Name from CLAUDE.md |
| Version | semver | Major.Minor.Patch |
| Status | enum | READY, INITIALIZED, PARTITIONED, DISCUSSED, PLANNED, IMPACT_ANALYZED, EXECUTING, EXECUTED, TESTS_SYNCED, INTEGRATED, VERIFIED, VERIFY_FAILED, COMPLETED |
| Current Milestone | string | Active milestone name or "None" |
| Decision Log | entries | Timestamped log of all changes |

### Backlog (.gsd-t/backlog.md)
| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Position | integer | Sequential, 1 = highest priority |
| Type | enum | bug, feature, improvement, ux, architecture |
| App | string | Target application |
| Category | string | Domain/module category |
| Description | string | Item summary |

### Contracts (.gsd-t/contracts/)
| Contract | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| command-interface-contract.md | Slash command file format and structure |
| file-format-contract.md | File naming and organization rules |
| integration-points.md | How components connect |
| backlog-file-formats.md | Backlog markdown structure |
| domain-structure.md | Domain directory layout |
| pre-commit-gate.md | Commit checklist contract |
| progress-file-format.md | Progress.md structure |
| wave-phase-sequence.md | Phase ordering rules |

## Workflow Phase Architecture

```
PARTITION → DISCUSS → PLAN → IMPACT → EXECUTE → TEST-SYNC → INTEGRATE → VERIFY → COMPLETE
```

| Phase | Mode | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| Partition | Solo only | Needs full cross-domain context |
| Discuss | Solo only | Always pauses for user input (even Level 3) |
| Plan | Solo only | Needs full cross-domain context |
| Impact | Solo only | Cross-cutting analysis |
| Execute | Solo or Team | Tasks within domains are independent |
| Test-Sync | Solo only | Sequential verification |
| Integrate | Solo only | Needs to see all seams |
| Verify | Solo or Team | Dimensions are independent |
| Complete | Solo only | Archival and tagging |

## Security Model

- **Zero dependencies**: No supply chain attack surface
- **Symlink protection**: `isSymlink()` checked at 18+ write sites
- **Input validation**: Project names, version strings, session IDs, project paths all validated
- **Path traversal prevention**: Heartbeat validates session_id regex, resolves paths, verifies containment
- **Command injection mitigation**: `execFileSync` with array args (not `execSync`)
- **Exclusive file creation**: Init uses `{ flag: "wx" }` for atomic create-or-fail
- **Resource limits**: Heartbeat stdin capped at 1MB, HTTP timeouts, 7-day file cleanup

## Design Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| 2026-02-07 | Zero external dependencies for CLI | Simplicity, no install failures, no supply chain risk | Using commander.js, yargs |
| 2026-02-07 | Markdown-only command files | Claude Code native format, no build step, human-readable | YAML frontmatter, JSON config |
| 2026-02-09 | Semantic versioning with git tags | Standard npm practice, enables update checks | CalVer, build numbers |
| 2026-02-12 | Heartbeat via Claude Code hooks | Non-invasive monitoring, no command file changes needed | Polling, WebSocket |
| 2026-02-13 | Semantic router over keyword matching | Better intent detection, fewer misroutes | Regex patterns, ML classifier |
| 2026-02-16 | Mandatory Playwright for all projects | Consistent E2E testing, no "we'll add tests later" | Optional testing, Jest-only |
| 2026-02-16 | Team mode default for scan | Parallel scanning faster, better results | Solo sequential scan |

## Known Architecture Concerns

1. **CLI single-file size**: bin/gsd-t.js at ~1,300 lines exceeds the 200-line convention, but splitting adds complexity for questionable benefit given zero-dependency constraint.
2. **Four-file synchronization**: Any command change requires updating README, GSD-T-README, CLAUDE-global template, and gsd-t-help. Manual process — no automated validation.
3. **Pre-Commit Gate unenforced**: Mental checklist in CLAUDE.md, not a git hook or CI check.
4. **No automated testing**: CLI relies on manual testing despite 52+ functions and 1,300 lines.
